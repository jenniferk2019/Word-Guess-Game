# Word-Guess-Game 

My game's theme is Sailor Moon and the word list is based on this anime. The purpose of this assignment was to create a word guess game using our knowledge of Javascript. 

How to Play:

Press any lower case key (a-z) to start the game. The game will randomly select a Sailor Moon theme word form its internal list. It will then display a blank word using underscores to represent the letters in the word.

If a correct letter is guessed, the game will reveal the letter in its correct place. If an incorrect letter is guessed. it will then add it to a list on the incorrectly guessed letters section, and lower the remaining guess-count.

If the user guesses the correct word, the game will continue with a new word.

If the user does not guess the correct city name, then the game resets.

Side notes:

This task by far was very difficult for me to accomplish. I kept getting lost in the chaos of my code, even when I pseudo-coded. I'm still not able to remember and grasp the understanding of Javascript functions, specifically when it comes to making the images appear when the correct word is chosen. I also had issues with the position of the audio file, and other CSS-related formatting. I worked and committed up until the very end of the assignment due time. I just hope with more practice I'll be able to grasp what I'm doing with more understanding and confidence.
