# Word-Guess-Game 

My game's theme is Sailor Moon and the word list is based on this anime-cartoon show. The purpose of this assignment was to create a word guess game using our knowledge of Javascript. 

Game should proceed as follows:

Press any lower case key (a-z) to start the game. The game will randomly select a Sailor Moon theme word from its internal list. It will then display a blank word using underscores to represent the letters in the word.

If a correct letter is guessed, the game will reveal the letter in its correct place. If an incorrect letter is guessed. it will then add it to a list on the incorrectly guessed letters section, and lower the remaining guess-count.

If the user guesses the correct word, the game will continue with a new word.

If the user does not guess the correct theme name, then the game resets.
