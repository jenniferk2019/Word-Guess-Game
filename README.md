# Word-Guess-Game 

My game's theme is Sailor Moon and the word list is based on this anime. The purpose of this assignment was to create a word guess game using our knowledge of Javascript. 

How to Play:

Press any lower case key (a-z) to start the game. The game will randomly select a Sailor Moon theme word from its internal list. It will then display a blank word using underscores to represent the letters in the word.

If a correct letter is guessed, the game will reveal the letter in its correct place. If an incorrect letter is guessed. it will then add it to a list on the incorrectly guessed letters section, and lower the remaining guess-count.

If the user guesses the correct word, the game will continue with a new word.

If the user does not guess the correct city name, then the game resets.

Side notes:

This task by far was very difficult for me to accomplish. I kept getting lost in the chaos of my code, on top finding new code templates/answers/videos/threads/etc. Even when I pseudo-coded, I'm still not able to remember and grasp the understanding of Javascript functions, specifically when it comes to making the dashes appear along side matching images (which I've downloaded and saved). Directions were provided but I'm not understanding the syntax of how I'm supposed to understand it, while also utilizing the directions to write the syntax. I also had issues with the position of the audio file, and other CSS-related formatting. I worked and committed almost up until the very end of the assignment due time, until I just simply couldn't finish due to simple brain-burn-out. I just hope with more practice (and definitley time, which is not on my side) I'll be able to grasp what I'm doing with more understanding and confidence. For now, I'm submitting quite an unfinished game, which I was hoping to complete and take joy in playing.
